# ICOOP - 2D Grid-Based Platformer (Java)
Java 2D Zelda-style game engine developed at EPFL (CS-107). Implements grid-based movement, tile collision detection, interactive objects (doors, switches, keys), enemy AI, and level progression. Built with an MVC-inspired architecture using Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns for clean, scalable design.
